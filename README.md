## Why this was created
i liked the idea of the sendit app (ngl.link aswell), so i wanted to do mine as well with my own UI touch. and the result is SE9SI.

## Features
1. You can share your Se9si pool in your Instagram, Facebook or even Snapchat story. just hit the 'Save Image' button in your panel, upload the image with your link included in the wanted platform. and youre all set !
2. Separated Backend, Frontend.
3. Database powered by MongoDB.
4. Very very basic login system.

## To-Do
1. instagram profile picture as a blurred background in the Send page.
2. improve the login system and make it more secure.
